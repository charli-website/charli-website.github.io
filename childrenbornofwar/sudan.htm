			<b><font size="2">Case Study: Darfur<br>

			<i>Robyn Wheeler</i></font></b><br>

			<br>

			<font size="2"><br>

			</font><b><font size="2">What is the background to the conflict?</font></b><br>

			</font><font size="2" face="Arial">The ongoing conflict in the 

			Darfur region of the Sudan continues to result in births as a result 

			of mass rape and sexual slavery. A long history of discontent was 

			pushed to major significance in 2003 when two rebel groups 

			representing the non-Arabs citizens of the region began to attack 

			government installations. The government swiftly empowered the 

			Janjaweed, a militia comprised of local Arabs, to strike back on 

			their behalf, and the war began. Hundreds of thousands of Sudanese 

			have been affected by this conflict either through famine, 

			displacement, murder or rape. <br>

			<br>

			<b>What is the nature and extent of the sexual violence?</b><br>

			As in many international conflict settings, sexual violence 

			including gang rape and sexual slavery has been used in Darfur as a 

			means to terrorize the civilian population. The Janjaweed, who are 

			documented as using rape as one of their primary methods of attack, 

			rely on the havoc they create and the psychological long-term 

			effects they are fostering.&nbsp;&nbsp; As they are conservative Muslims 

			themselves, they are fully aware of the resulting stigma and 

			destruction that their sexual violence causes: indeed, there is 

			evidence that this is the primary motivation for these campaigns of 

			mass rape. One mother remembers being told during her rape, &#8220;We want 

			to change the color of your children,&#8221; which indicates forced 

			impregnation as a further tool of genocide (Raghavan, 2004).<br>

			<br>

			<b>How many children as estimated born as a result?</b><br>

			Specific statistics do not exist tracking the number of babies born 

			from rape during this conflict, but speculation is that thousands of 

			rapes have occurred since the conflict began.&nbsp; The difficulty with 

			assessing specific numbers lies with the conservative nature of 

			society.&nbsp; Rape is a taboo that is not to be talked about and 

			consequently the majority of rapes go unreported.&nbsp; This is coupled 

			with the Sudanese government&#8217;s track record of non-punishment of the 

			perpetrators of sexual crimes.<br>

			<br>

			<b>What is the situation of the children and their mothers? </b><br>

			Rape victims in Darfur are often blamed for the violence and it is 

			believed in many villages that it is impossible to become 

			impregnated from unwanted sex. The women and men in Darfur society 

			are culturally raised to believe that rape is avoidable and that the 

			sexual violence the woman has endured should have been prevented.&nbsp; 

			The women often feel displaced from their community as a result of 

			their ordeal and end up ostracized either by the community or their 

			own shame.&nbsp; A child born as the result of such violence in most 

			cases ends the mother&#8217;s future.&nbsp; She is no longer marriageable 

			because there is a cultural imperative in this society that a bride 

			be a virgin.&nbsp; As a result, the victim has cast shame on her entire 

			family by being raped and they will likely react by ostracizing her 

			and the baby. Therefore, if a pregnancy results from rape the mother 

			and child carry a stigma with them for the remainder of their lives. 

			Little research is available to date regarding the infants, possibly 

			because the conflict is still relatively recent and babies are just 

			now being born.&nbsp; Long-term assessment is required, but initial 

			research indicates the babies are heavily stigmatized and rarely are 

			accepted by the community or in some cases even the mother. Evidence 

			suggests that even where communities accept the babies, they will 

			still be observed for ill temperament and potentially abandoned as a 

			result in the future. According to press reports, such children have 

			been referred to as &#8220;Janjaweed babies&#8221; or &#8220;dirty babies&#8221; by the 

			communities into which they are born. Aid workers have reported 

			rumors of infanticides, but these reports have not been 

			independently verified. <br>

			<br>

			<b>What has been the humanitarian response?</b><br>

			UNICEF asserted in February 2005 that &#8220;dozens of babies are being 

			born in Darfur to mothers raped during the ongoing conflict in 

			western Sudan.&#8221; This organization is one of the only organizations 

			discovered through research that is actively promoting attention be 

			paid to the new generation of babies that have been born as a result 

			of the systematic rape of women in Darfur.&nbsp; They recommend diffusing 

			the stigma through education of the community, believing that once 

			the members of the community realize the rape was not the mother&#8217;s 

			fault and that an innocent child cannot be held accountable for 

			their father&#8217;s actions, the stigma will disappear and the mother and 

			child will receive the support they need. In the meantime they 

			emphasize the need for humanitarian organizations to focus on making 

			sure this population is not discriminated against in refugee camps 

			and that they have equal access to health care and education.</font></p>
